/////Constructor
//public Joystick​(int port)
//Construct an instance of a joystick.
//Parameters:
//port - The port index on the Driver Station that the joystick is plugged into.

/////Methods

///Used:

//public final double getX()
//Get the X value of the joystick. This depends on the mapping of the joystick connected to the current port.
//Returns: The X value of the joystick.

//public final double getY()
//Get the Y value of the joystick. This depends on the mapping of the joystick connected to the current port.
//Returns: The Y value of the joystick.

///Unused:

//public void setXChannel​(int channel)
//Set the channel associated with the X axis.
//channel - The channel to set the axis to.

//public void setYChannel​(int channel)
//Set the channel associated with the Y axis.
//channel - The channel to set the axis to.

//public void setZChannel​(int channel)
//Set the channel associated with the Z axis.
//channel - The channel to set the axis to.

//public void setThrottleChannel​(int channel)
//Set the channel associated with the throttle axis.
//channel - The channel to set the axis to.

//public void setTwistChannel​(int channel)
//Set the channel associated with the twist axis.
//channel - The channel to set the axis to.

//public int getXChannel()
//Get the channel currently associated with the X axis.
//Return: The channel for the axis.

//public int getYChannel()
//Get the channel currently associated with the Y axis.
//Returns: The channel for the axis.

//public int getZChannel()
//Get the channel currently associated with the Z axis.

//Get the twist value of the current joystick. This depends on the mapping of the joystick connected to the current port.
//Returns: The Twist value of the joystick.

//public double getThrottle()
//Get the throttle value of the current joystick. This depends on the mapping of the joystick connected to the current port.
//Returns: The Throttle value of the joystick.

//public boolean getTrigger()
//Read the state of the trigger on the joystick.
//Returns: The state of the trigger.

//public boolean getTriggerPressed()
//Whether the trigger was pressed since the last check.
//Returns: Whether the button was pressed since the last check.

//public boolean getTriggerReleased()
//Whether the trigger was released since the last check.
//Returns:
//Whether the button was released since the last check.
